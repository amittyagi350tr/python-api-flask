### FUNCTIONS ARE FIRST CLASS CITIZENS OF PYTHON LANGUAGE

    functions get treated the same way as objects of any other data type in python


1) Every variable has a data type: Functions should have a proper data type
2) A variable is allowed to passed as an argument to a function: Function objects should also be
    allowed to be passed as arguments TO OTHER FUNCTIONS!
3) A variable can be stored in a data collection: a function object should also get stored in 
    a data collection

4) A variable can be returned from a function. A function object can be returned from a function

5) a variable's reference can be copied into another variable. a function's address can be copied into another 
variable also

There are some methods that can work with objects 
        -Every object has  a property called "name"
        -obj1.update_name() #only update_name for obj1 object
        -use self and regular methods for such cases!



There are some methods that ONLY need to work with class name

        -update a class member for e.g College_name

        Student.college_name()

Virtual Environment : Isolated project setup.

ONE TIME SETUP: at the start of the project


step 1 : python -m venv  <name-of virtual environment>
            e.g : python -m venv    python_api_development

Notes:
        a) the virtual environment is created in the main folder of your project

step 2: installing all required dependencies (libraries you need to complete the project)

            a) Create a requirements.txt file in the main folder/virtual environent of your project.
            b) List the name of all libraries to be installed
            c) run a command
                    pip install -r   <path of your requiremnts.txt>
                   e.g: pip install -r  /home/Harshit/Desktop/python_api_development/requirements.txt



EACH TIME YOU START NEW SESSION OF DEVELOPMENT

Windows
        type the path of activate.ps1 file(inside Scripts directory of your virtual environent folder)
        in the terminal
    

MAC & Linux:
        source  <path of activate file from lib directory of virtual environent>

Note:
    Activated environment is visible on your terminal prompt usually

ONE FINAL THING : select the name of your virtual environment in VS Code
            -either from top right in jupyter notebook (ipynb file)
            -or bottom from .py file
